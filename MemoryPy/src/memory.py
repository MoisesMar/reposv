Welcome to the Code Comments for Memory. Code Comments is a series of simple games with detailed comments in the source code, so you can see how the game works.

The text in between the triple-double-quotes are comments. The Python interpreter ignores any text in between them, so we can add any comments about the source code without affecting the program. In general for Code Comments, the comments will describe the lines of code above the comment. It helps to view this file either on the Code Comments site or with a text editor that does "syntax highlighting", so that the comments appear in a separate color and are easier to distinguish from the code.

This Code Comments assumes you know some basic Python programming. If you are a beginner and would like to learn computer programming, there is a free book online called "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" at http://inventwithpython.com

The Code Comments programs make references to sections of this book throughout the program. This Code Comments can also teach you how to use the Pygame library to make your own games with graphics, animation, and sound. You can download Pygame from http://pygame.org and view its documentation at http://pygame.org/docs/

HOW TO PLAY MEMORY:
Click on one of the boxes to reveal the icon (that is, the colored shape) underneth. Click on another box where you think its matching twin is.

A QUICK WORD ABOUT THE DATA STRUCTURES USED IN MEMORY:
Variables can hold values of different types, such as integers (1, 2, 42, -5), floating point numbers (3.14, 5.0, -3.77) or strings ('Hello', 'SPAM', '42'). Some data types such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries can hold multiple other values. For example, [1, 2, 'Hello'] is a list value that holds three values (two integers and a string). Lists can also contain other lists as well.

We have a data structure that represents which boxes on the board contain what icons. It will be a list of lists of two-string tuples. Here is an example:
    mainBoard = [[(DONUT, RED), (DIAMOND, BLUE)], [(DIAMOND, BLUE'), (DONUT, RED)]]
This would be the data structure for a 2x2 board. Because it is a list of lists, the indexes we use can map to X Y coordinates, e.g. we can use mainBoard[0][0] for the top leftmost box, mainBoard[1][0] is the box to the right and mainBoard[0][1] is the box below the top leftmost one.

Remember, our XY coordinate system increases the X coordinate as we go to the right and increase the Y coordinate as we go down. It looks like this:

0,0    1,0    2,0    3,0    4,0
0,1    1,1    2,1    3,1    4,1
0,2    1,2    2,2    3,2    4,2
0,3    1,3    2,3    3,3    4,3
0,4    1,4    2,4    3,4    4,4

So the information for the icon for the box that is third from the left, second from the top would be at mainBoard[2][1]:

mainBoard[0][0]    mainBoard[1][0]    mainBoard[2][0]    mainBoard[3][0]    mainBoard[4][0]
mainBoard[0][1]    mainBoard[1][1]    mainBoard[2][1]    mainBoard[3][1]    mainBoard[4][1]
mainBoard[0][2]    mainBoard[1][2]    mainBoard[2][2]    mainBoard[3][2]    mainBoard[4][2]
mainBoard[0][3]    mainBoard[1][3]    mainBoard[2][3]    mainBoard[3][3]    mainBoard[4][3]
mainBoard[0][4]    mainBoard[1][4]    mainBoard[2][4]    mainBoard[3][4]    mainBoard[4][4]

Inside the list of lists, we store a tuple to denote the shape and color of the icon. The first item will be the color (which technically is itself a tuple of three integers, see the color constant variables below) and the second item is a string that describes the shape (either DONUT, SQUARE, DIAMOND, LINES, or OVAL).

This is the complete data structure for which boxes have which icons.

The data structure to keep track of which boxes have already been matched and revealed is also a list of lists, but it just contains True if the box should be revealed when drawn on the screen and False if it should be covered up. See the revealedBoxes variable for details.

There will be COLS x ROWS number of boxes on the board, however we need pairs of icons, so we divide that number by two. Note that if COLS and ROWS are both odd numbers, we will end up trying to divide an odd number by 2. This would create a bug in our program. Just be sure to set at least one of COLS or ROWS to an even number to prevent this.

    icons[:numIconsUsed] would be a slice with half of the icons we need. We double the content by multiplying this slice by 2. (Multiplying a list by an integer is called list replication.)"""
